/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core-philosophy This ruleset allows open read and write access to all documents and collections.
 * This is intended for rapid prototyping and should NOT be used in a production environment.
 * @data-structure All data resides in top-level collections: /users, /projects, /messages, and /notifications.
 * Each document ID is explicitly specified to be distinct from autoIDs (but such integrity is NOT validated).
 * @key-security-decisions Open access is granted for all read and write operations, without authentication or authorization checks.
