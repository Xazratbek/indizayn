/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode. Authorization is enforced, but data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores portfolio projects created by users.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: Stores direct messages between users.
 * - /notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications for users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All reads and writes are currently allowed to all documents in all collections.
