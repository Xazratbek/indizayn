/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping and ease of development. It provides a baseline level of
 * security focused on user identity and ownership while minimizing data validation to allow for schema
 * flexibility during the early stages of development.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores individual user profiles, with the document ID being the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - `/projects/{projectId}`: Stores design portfolio projects.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user profiles.
 * - Projects are publicly readable, but only the owner can create, update, or delete them.
 * - No data validation is performed beyond checking document ownership and existence on write operations.
