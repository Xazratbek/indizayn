/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset is in prototyping mode and allows any read or write.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database consists of four top-level collections: `users`, `projects`, `messages`, and `notifications`.
 *   - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles, where `{userId}` is the Firebase Auth UID.
 *   - `/projects/{projectId}`: Stores design portfolio projects.
 *   - `/messages/{messageId}`: Stores direct messages between users.
 *   - `/notifications/{notificationId}`: Stores notifications for users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - WARNING: This ruleset is in prototyping mode and allows any read or write. This is insecure and must be changed before production.
