/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the design portfolio application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode and uses a permissive security posture, granting read and write access to all documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database contains collections for users, projects, messages and notifications.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * All collections are accessible for both reading and writing. This is acceptable for early prototyping.
